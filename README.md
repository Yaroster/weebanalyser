# To do:
There's a lot to do !
- Alpha:
  - [ ] Build Prototype
  - [ ] Configure datasets using [MalScraper](https://github.com/Kylart/MalScraper) (type of weeb, percentage, most watched genre and anime/manga) 
  - [ ] Build algorythm (I will use a static ruleset, though in the future I would love to use Tensorflow)<br>(via the UARC and by complexity)
